# Non-unique elements

You are given a non-empty list of integers (X). For this task, you should return a list consisting of only the non-unique elements in this list. To do so you will need to remove all unique elements (elements which are contained in a given list only once). When solving this task, do not change the order of the list.

Example: [1, 2, 3, 1, 3] 1 and 3 non-unique elements and result will be [1, 3, 1, 3].

- [1,2,3,1,3] becomes [1,3,1,3]
- [1,2,3,4,5] becomes []
- [5,5,5,5,5] becomes [5,5,5,5,5]
- [10,9,10,10,9,8] becomes [10,9,10,10,9]
